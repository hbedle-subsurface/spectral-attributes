# Adding the control-panel pop-out to a repository

`assets/panelout.js` puts an **Open controls in a window** button on the header
panel of every module. The student gets the thumbnail and the sliders in a
second window and can keep them beside the panels they drive.

It is the live companion to `assets/popout.js`, which does the same for the
exercises. The exercise copy is static, because exercise text does not change.
This one is connected: every slider moved in the second window changes the
module in the first, and the header canvases are mirrored back so the second
window shows whatever the module drew.

The same file goes in every teaching repository, unchanged.

---

## 1. Copy the file

Copy `assets/panelout.js` from any repository that already has it. Do not edit
it. If it needs a change, change it everywhere.

## 2. Add one script tag per module

Next to the other shared scripts:

```html
<script src="../assets/count.js"></script>
<script src="../assets/popout.js"></script>
<script src="../assets/panelout.js"></script>
```

Order does not matter. The script waits for `DOMContentLoaded` and touches
nothing but the header panel.

## 3. What the module has to provide

One thing, already true of every module built to the house template: the header
panel is `<div class="labhead">`. If it is missing, the button does not appear
and the page is otherwise untouched.

**No module JavaScript has to change.** The clone's inputs are not the module's
inputs. When one of them moves, its value is copied onto the real input in the
first window and an ordinary `input` event is fired there. Every module already
listens for that event on `document`, so it cannot tell the difference between a
slider moved in its own window and one moved in the second. Buttons call
`click()` on their counterpart, and a pointer press on a cloned canvas is
forwarded to the real canvas at the same fractional position, so a module that
lets a line be dragged across a map still works from the second window.

## 4. What it does to the page

While the pop-out is open the real panel is moved into a zero-height wrapper
rather than hidden with `display:none`. The modules measure canvas width from
the parent element, and an element that is `display:none` has no width to
measure, so hiding it that way would collapse every plot on the page. A slim bar
takes its place with a **Bring them back** button.

Closing either window restores the panel.

## 5. Check it

Open a module, click the button, and confirm:

- moving a slider in the second window changes the panels in the first
- the thumbnail in the second window follows
- moving a slider in the first window moves the matching slider in the second
- a second module opens its own window rather than replacing the first
- closing the pop-out puts the panel back and the plots redraw at full width

## 6. What it does and does not do

**Does:** clone markup that is already on the page into a second window and
forward events between the two.

**Does not:** fetch anything, send anything, store anything, or set a cookie. It
works from a `file://` copy with no network, which is the case that matters when
a student is working from a downloaded folder.
